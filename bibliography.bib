abstract = {Despite broad public support for wind energy in principle, windfarm developments are often met with local opposition. There is theoretical, case-based and anecdotal evidence to suggest that 'the local' is relevant for planning process outcomes, but the nature and extent of this relevance is not so clear. We embark on an initial exploration of local factors that, on aggregate, may be of relevance to planning outcomes of proposed windfarms in rural England. Applying a broad scanning approach we use an existing small area GIS dataset of 117 variables related to education, health, demography, employment and housing. We identify a number of strong associations, and discuss to what extent these make sense in the light of existing literature on environmental equity and social capital, or throw up questions for further study. Notwithstanding the methodological caveats of this explorative study, and the scope for more in-depth analysis, our findings suggests that beyond the myriad of individual planning cases, the emerging landscape of wind energy development in England is markedly uneven, and sometimes inequitable. Evidence of the latter emerges notably through the strong significance of local democratic deficit (i.e. low voter turn-out) as a predictor of a 'positive' planning outcome for windfarms and the further strengthening of predictive associations at the appeal stage. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the European Union, electricity production from wind energy is projected to increase by approximately 16{\%} until 2020. The Austrian energy plan aims at increasing the currently installed wind power capacity from approximately 1GW to 3GW until 2020 including an additional capacity of 700MW until 2015. The aim of this analysis is to assess economically viable wind turbine sites under current feed-in tariffs considering constraints imposed by infrastructure, the natural environment and ecological preservation zones in Austria. We analyze whether the policy target of installing an additional wind power capacity of 700MW until 2015 is attainable under current legislation and developed a GIS based decision system for wind turbine site selection. Results show that the current feed-in tariff of 9.7 ct kWh-1 may trigger an additional installation of 3544MW. The current feed-in tariff can therefore be considered too high as wind power deployment would exceed the target by far. Our results indicate that the targets may be attained more cost-effectively by applying a lower feed-in tariff of 9.1 ct kWh-1. Thus, windfall profits at favorable sites and deadweight losses of policy intervention can be minimized while still guaranteeing the deployment of additional wind power capacities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Twenty states plus the District of Columbia now have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in place that requires a certain percentage of energy to come from renewable sources by a specific year. With renewable energy on the verge of massive growth, much research emphasis is put on enabling the implementation of these technologies. This paper presents a novel method of site selection for wind turbine farms in New York State, based on a spatial cost-revenue optimization. The algorithm used for this is built in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop 9.3.1 software and consists of three stages. The first stage excludes sites that are infeasible for wind turbine farms, based on land use and geological constraints. The second stage identifies the best feasible sites based on the expected net present value from four major cost and revenue categories that are spatially dependent: revenue from generated electricity, costs from access roads, power lines and land clearing. The third stage assesses the ecological impacts on bird and their habitats. The proposed spatial multi-criteria methodology is then implemented in New York State and the results were compared with the locations of existing wind turbine farms. The wind farm site selection tool presented in this paper provides insights into the most feasible sites for a large geographic area based on user inputs, and can assist the planning of wind developers, utilities, ISO's and State governments in attaining renewable portfolio standards. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

The aim of the analysis was to identify which survey-items were predictors of respondents' estimates of the number of wind turbines they believed the region could reasonably support (i.e. capacity estimates). The results revealed that the majority of respondents would endorse some local development; however, there was substantial variability in the upper level that was considered acceptable. Prominent predictors included general attitude, perceived knowledge of wind power, community attachment, environmental values, visual attractiveness of wind turbines, and issues relating to perceived fairness and equity.

It is organized into six chapters. After an introductory setting chapter, which defines the scope of land-use suitability analysis, an overview of relevant GIS technology is provided in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 offers an historical account of the development of GIS. It also discusses the development of GIS in the context of evolving perspectives of planning. Chapter 4 gives an overview of the methods for GIS-based land-use suitability modeling. The overview provides a background against which selected case studies are discussed in Chapter 5. The concluding chapter summarized the main points of the monographs and discusses problems and prospects for GIS-based land-use suitability analysis. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As global growth in renewable energy projects accelerates, site identification will come to the forefront, where a key consideration is to minimise the environmental impact of the development. A large area of southern England (17,094km2) was assessed for suitability for wind and solar farm developments in three stages using geographic information systems. A multi-criteria decision making framework incorporating an analytical hierarchy process involving expert stakeholders was applied, which is a novel approach for this type of study. A binary constraint layer was created identifying entirely unsuitable locations. A factor layer was developed to indicate suitability in relation to a range of variables. Suitability layers for wind farm and solar farm development were then created covering the region. The environmental constraints used in the model accounted for over 60{\%} of the study area for both wind and solar developments. Suitability for wind energy was generally low, with only 0.5km2 accounting for the 'most suitable' category. Solar suitability was higher overall; and a greater area (294km2) within the 'most suitable' category, suggesting the region is better suited for solar farm developments. Stakeholder input resulted in higher weightings for economic considerations for the solar model, prompting the most suitable areas to coincide with locations of the national grid connections. A sensitivity analysis indicated that model was generally reliable. This method can be used to assist appropriate site selection for onshore renewable energy projects across large geographical areas, helping to minimise their environmental impacts.},

The proposed approach is composed of a set of sequential steps that include primary energy consumption estimation, renewable energy potential estimation, energy self-sufficiency analysis, and composite map preparation using Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS is used to analyze solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and hydro-power potential within Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Potential sites are determined based on geographic, topographic, and land use constraints. Evacuees' population and forest radiation levels are specifically considered in the context of consequent issues emanating from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis. Energy self-sufficiency analysis has been conducted for years 2020 and 2030. A composite map showing potential sites and their interrelation to the above renewable energy resources has also been presented. These results may support decision making in regional renewable energy planning, by providing information on regional potentials and restrictions to different energy stakeholders. This can help to build an energy developmental vision, which can drive regional energy development towards sustainability. The proposed approach can also be applied to other Japanese municipalities or regions.

Various qualitative and quantitative methods have been employed, including regression analysis. Strong associations have been discovered between the outcome of local authority planning decisions, the opinions of local planning officers, the opinions of parish councils where the proposed windfarms are to be sited and the opinions of landscape protection groups. The attitude of people in the immediate vicinity of proposed windfarms is found to be the most important influence on the decisions made by local authorities. However, the local perception of the economic impact is of crucial importance in forming this judgement, as is the national political environment. The expected attitude of Appeal Inspectors is also important. It is concluded that there is a lot that wind power developers could do to improve the prospects of planning success. This includes engaging in local 'parish council' politics, talking to the closest residents to proposed schemes and encouraging local pro-wind power campaigns. Future projects are likely to be favoured by installing viewing towers at the tops of turbines to encourage visitors and in selling shares in the schemes to local people. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper deals with site selection problems for wind power plants and aims to propose a structural procedure for determining the most feasible sites. The application area is Western Turkey. The methodology is mainly composed of two stages: the first stage is pre-elimination of infeasible sites, and the second stage is evaluation of the available ones. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to generate layers of data and to apply the elimination criteria and constraints. The alternative land areas are handled in terms of identical-sized grids, which are large enough to install one wind turbine each. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is then used to rank and sort the grids via the identified evaluation criteria. The problem is evaluated in 13 fields, which are a collection of several grids in order to evaluate larger scale areas to construct wind farms rather than for individual turbines. The evaluations are made both at grid (micro) and field (macro) levels and both deterministic and uncertain data are used. The results reveal a high level of consensus on the most feasible sites between the different MCDA methods applied. The proposed methodology provides a structured decision aid, which can be applied to other energy site selection problems.},

Discourse analytical techniques are then used to consider how anti-windfarm campaigners manage accusations of 'Not In My Back Yard' (NIMBYism). This is done partly by linking their cause with wider environmental objectives. Although discourses and logistical regression models have very different ontologies, the paper demonstrates that there is no inevitable conflict between the epistemologies used in these two different methods, despite differences in the type of data being analysed.

We use principal components data reduction, z-score data normalization, and Probit regression analyses on a unique revealed preference dataset covering 354 wind farm applications and planning authority decisions between 1990 and 2011. Notably, a unique measure of variable importance is employed that mitigates statistical problems and allows for the ranking of predictors according to their relative influences. Findings reveal that the duration of the local appeal process, decisions of local authorities and inspectors, identities of the appellants, and, projects that conflict with strategic development plans or generate visual externalities emerge as key influences affecting planning approval. Project technology features such as area, rated output capacity, and hub height, as well as site wind endowments, appear to be of less but significant importance. Alternatively, we find that proximity to dwellings, towns, or protected habitats does not influence planning outcomes.},

abstract = {Local protests against renewable energy facilities have added fuel to the debate about the so-called NIMBY (not in my back yard) effect. This paper identifies six 'variables' that can hamper the comparison between different public perception studies, and offers two broad conclusions. On aggregate, proximity does have strong influence on public attitudes to proposed projects, but the nature, strength and spatial scale of this effect may vary according to local context and 'value' of the land. Residents of stigmatised places are more likely to welcome facilities that are relatively 'green', while people who derive a more positive sense of identity from particular rural landscapes are likely to resist such potential developments, especially if they also live there. Secondly, the fear of being branded a NIMBY, and the positive ethics associated with the notion of renewable are both likely to 'colour' the responses of many interviewees. These aspects need to be clarified and accounted for in analyses of elicited responses, both quantitative and qualitative, if we are to improve our understanding of the social construction of individual attitudes in siting conflicts. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper aims to understand different outcomes of implementation of wind power deployment programmes. Geographical variables such as quantity of wind resources are in themselves insufficient to explain patterns of implementation of wind power. To enhance the review of the factors affecting wind power deployment we also made a systematic comparison of six country cases: Denmark, Spain, Germany, Scotland, the Netherlands, and England/Wales. The impact of four key institutional variables is examined and put into a scheme of a set of potential hypothesis about their inter-relationships. These are influenced by different national traditions: planning systems; financial support mechanisms; landscape protection organisations and patterns of ownership of wind power. (1) Planning systems, which favour wind power are essential, and in all cases national planning policies generally intend to support wind power development, but planning institutions show a wide variety with clear differences in implementation results. (2) Systems of financial support are also a sine qua non for development but they also vary in their effectiveness across country and time in the study. Robust and consistent support regimes in Denmark, Germany and Spain have speeded developments. (3) Landscape protection organisations vary in strength in a range between England/Wales (very strong and influential) to Spain (non-existent). Strong and effective opposition to wind developments is always primarily rooted in landscape values. (4) Local ownership patterns coincide with higher rates of wind power deployment than remote, corporate ownership. Local involvement recruits conditional support for projects and is related to traditions of energy activism. Such traditions are strongest in Denmark and Germany and weakest in Spain, England/Wales and Scotland. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study of public attitudes to onshore windfarm development in south-west Scotland. Specifically, it explores the influences of different development models on attitudes to windfarms by comparing public attitudes towards a community-owned windfarm on the Isle of Gigha with attitudes towards several developer-owned windfarms on the adjacent Kintyre peninsula. The study, conducted in 2006, used a questionnaire-based survey (n = 106) to test the hypothesis that community ownership would lead to greater public acceptance of windfarms. It also examined the attitudes of both residents and tourists towards the impacts of onshore windfarms on landscapes and seascapes, including cumulative impacts. The data show that the Gigha respondents were consistently more positive about wind power than were the Kintyre residents. However, the differences were differences of degree rather than diametrically opposing viewpoints. The most significant concerns about windfarms were intermittent production and visual impact, but majorities in both areas nevertheless regarded their visual impact as positive. The data also indicate that local attitudes could become even more positive if future windfarms were owned by local communities. The fact that the residents of Gigha have affectionately dubbed their turbines 'the Three Dancing Ladies' is indicative of the positive psychological effects of community ownership. These results support the contention that a change of development model towards community ownership could have a positive effect on public attitudes towards windfarm developments in Scotland. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

annote = {common with most developed countries, Scottish society has grown used to a highly centralised energy infrastructure in which power stations are often remote from centres of population. Conventionally, the thinking was that ‘a better power station was always a bigger power station farther away' (Patterson, 2007: 57). This spatial remoteness has created a psychological distance between people and energy generation (Devine-Wright, 2005b), but the conventional approach is now being challenged by the rise of renewable energy which is bringing power close to the people. Having been ‘end-of-wire captive consumers', increasing numbers of individuals and communities are now forming new, active and participatory connections with energy generation and supply (Walker and Cass, 2007: 464) as they take on ‘energy citizenship' (Devine-Wright, 2007).

One sector receiving particular attention within the UK is that of electricity generation. As such, the government has introduced ambitious targets for increasing renewable generating capacity within the country. Wind turbines are expected to play a significant role in meeting these targets; however, despite high levels of support for the technology in principle, specific projects are often delayed or rejected on account of local opposition. This study aimed to establish how attitudes towards development might vary with respect to increasing distance from the identified sites. Participants were required to register their opinion towards development at a number of on- and off-shore locations in the UK. The results indicated that participants were most favourable to offshore development and least favourable to development at the identified sites. Attitudes to onshore development indicated that so long as a proposed location was anticipated to be 'out of sight' it was considered in relatively general terms. The results are discussed with reference to site visibility and landscape concerns and clearly support calls for a shift towards community-focussed development strategies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is a collection of best papers presented at an international research conference held in Tramelan (Switzerland) in February 2006. While there are ambitious government targets to increase the share of renewable energy in many countries, it is increasingly recognized that social acceptance may be a constraining factor in achieving this target. This is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy, which has become a subject of contested debates in several countries largely due to its visual impact on landscapes. This paper introduces three dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio-political, community and market acceptance. Factors influencing socio-political and community acceptance are increasingly recognized as being important for understanding the apparent contradictions between general public support for renewable energy innovation and the difficult realization of specific projects. The third dimension, market acceptance, has received less attention so far and provides opportunities for further research, particularly from management scholars. ?? 2006.},

In Poland, wind energy is expected to play a mayor role in fulfilling the recent targets set out by the national policy. As the utilisation of wind energy is perceived to be associated with various negative impacts, this kind of energy source should be systematically addressed by related spatial policy instruments to ensure its harmonisation with infrastructural, ecological and socio-economic systems. The objective of this study is to develop an approach to support the decision making process connected with the site selection for wind energy projects using a geographical information system. Available locations for wind farm sites were investigated according to defined criteria reflecting the spatial and ecological policy and regulations. The technical and economic potential was estimated to quantify the conditions of the case study region regarding the utilisation of the wind source. The methodology was applied to the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Voivodeship, since no such study is available for the region.

abstract = {Increasing population and life standards causes fossil fuel consumption to increase. Due to this increasing consumption, fossil fuels are being depleted rapidly. In addition to rapid exhaustion, another important problem associated with fossil fuels is that their consumption has major negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, many countries around the world have included renewable energy systems (RES) in their future energy plans so that they can produce reliable and environmentally friendly energy. Parallel to this trend, various RES have been identified and recently integrated into the current energy network of Turkey as well. However, it should be recognized that renewable energy resources are not fully environmentally safe. Different RES are associated with different environmental impacts. In planning the future energy development of a country, evaluation of renewable energy resources potentials together with their associated environmental impacts is critical. The aim of this study is to create a decision support system for site selection of wind turbines using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Wind energy potential and environmental fitness/acceptability are used as decision criteria for the site selection process. Potential environmental impacts of wind generation are identified in accordance with Turkish legislations and previous studies; and represented as fuzzy objectives of the decision problem. Wind potential map of Turkey generated by General Directorate of Electrical Power Resources Survey and Development is used to identify economically feasible locations in terms of wind energy generation. A study area composed of Usak, Aydin, Denizli, Mugla, and Burdur provinces in Turkey is selected and divided into 250 m ?? 250 m grids. Each grid represents an alternative location for a wind turbine or group of wind turbines. Fuzzy environmental objectives such as "Acceptable in terms of noise level", "Acceptable in terms of bird habitat", "Acceptable in terms of safety and aesthetics" and "Safe in terms of natural reserves" associated with wind turbines are identified based on previous research and each of these objectives are represented by a fuzzy set. Individual satisfaction degree of each of these environmental objectives for each grid is calculated. Then these individual satisfactions are aggregated into an overall satisfaction degree using various aggregator operators such as "and", "or", and "order weighted averaging." Thus, an overall satisfaction degree of all the environmental objectives is obtained for each grid in the study area. A map of environmental fitness is developed in GIS environment by using these overall satisfaction degrees. Then this map is utilized together with the wind potential map of Turkey to identify both potentially and environmentally feasible wind turbine locations within the study area. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Six distinct strands of research are identified,summarized and critiqued: public support for switching from conventional energy sources to wind energy; aspects of turbines associated with negative perceptions; the impact of physical proximity to turbines; acceptance over time of wind farms; NIMBYism as an explanation for negative perceptions; and, finally, the impact of local involvement on perceptions. Research across these strands is characterized by opinion poll studies of general beliefs and case studies of perceptions of specific developments. In both cases, research is fragmented and has failed to adequately explain, rather than merely describe, perceptual processes.The article argues for more theoretically informed empirical research,grounded in social science concepts and methods.A multidimensional framework is proposed that goes beyond the NIMBY label and integrates previous findings with social and environmental psychological theory.},

In this study, a GIS-based multi-criteria approach was developed to identify the areas that are best suited to wind energy development in Northeast Nebraska, USA. Seven criteria were adopted in this method, including distance to roads, closeness to transmission lines, population density, wind potential, land use, distance to cities, slope and exclusionary areas. The suitability of wind farm development was modeled by a weighted overlay of geospatial layers corresponding to these criteria. The results indicate that the model is capable of identifying locations highly suited for wind farm development.

abstract = {In the face of the broad political call for an “energy turnaround”, we are currently witnessing three essential trends with regard to energy infrastructure planning, energy generation and storage: from planned production towards fluctuating production on the basis of renewable energy sources, from centralized generation towards decentralized generation and from expensive energy carriers towards cost-free energy carriers. These changes necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Even though most of these modifications are inherently motivated by geospatial questions and challenges, the integration of energy system models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of previous approaches in using GIS in renewable energy-related projects, extracts distinct challenges from these previous efforts and, finally, defines a set of core future research avenues for GIS-based energy infrastructure planning with a focus on the use of renewable energy. These future research avenues comprise the availability base data and their “geospatial awareness”, the development of a generic and unified data model, the usage of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and crowdsourced data in analysis processes, the integration of 3D building models and 3D data analysis, the incorporation of network topologies into GIS, the harmonization of the heterogeneous views on aggregation issues in the fields of energy and GIS, fine-grained energy demand estimation from freely-available data sources, decentralized storage facility planning, the investigation of GIS-based public participation mechanisms, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, data privacy aspects and, finally, the development of a new dynamic power market design.},

abstract = {An increase in public awareness regarding the negative impact of traditional power-generating methods, especially coal and oil-fired power stations, on the environment has created a demand for developing and using environmentally friendly renewable energy. Wind power is a popular and safe form of renewable energy. It can be economically viable, does not produce any physical pollution and can contribute radically to the reduction in air pollution. In the UK, the demand for wind energy is mounting. However, achieving the goal set by the EU will require a substantial expansion. Planning and environmental restrictions and conflicts would inevitably accompany this growth. A questionnaire targeting relevant public and private sectors in the UK has revealed the lack of coherent national criteria for locating wind farms. Using information from the questionnaire and the available published literature, simple Geographical Information System (GIS)-assisted wind farm location criteria were developed for the UK. A GIS (IDRISI) was employed to apply these criteria using two different methods to combine information layers for a site in Lancashire. The first considered all the layers as being equally important and gave them equal weight. The second grouped the layers and graded them according to perceived importance. The outputs were composed of classes from 0 to 10, where 0 represents ideal locations and 10 represents unsuitable locations. Using the second method has resulted in a slight increase in the geographical extent for the most suitable sites. These maps can be used to assist in the decision-making process when locating wind farm sites. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Investigation of pesticide impacts on human health depends on good measures of exposure. Historical exposure data are needed to study health outcomes, such as cancer, that involve long latency periods, and other outcomes that are a function of the timing of exposure. Environmental or biological samples collected at the time of epidemiologic study may not represent historical exposure levels. To study the relationship between residential exposure to pesticides and breast cancer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, historical records of pesticide use were integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate exposures from large-scale pesticide applications between 1948 and 1995. Information on pesticide use for gypsy moth and other tree/vegetative pest control, cranberry bog cultivation, other agriculture, mosquito control, recreational turf management, and rights-of-way maintenance is included in the database. Residents living within or near pesticide use areas may be exposed through inhalation due to drift and volatilization and through dermal contact and ingestion at the time of application or in later years from pesticides that deposit on soil, accumulate in crops, or migrate to groundwater. Procedures were developed to use the GIS to estimate the relative intensity of past exposures at each study subject's Cape Cod addresses over the past 40 years, taking into account local meteorological data, distance and direction from a residence to a pesticide use source area, size of the source area, application by ground-based or aerial methods, and persistent or nonpersistent character of the pesticide applied. The resulting individual-level estimates of relative exposure intensity can be used in conjunction with interview data to obtain more complete exposure assessment in an epidemiologic study. While the database can improve environmental epidemiological studies involving pesticides, it simultaneously illustrates important data gaps that cannot be filled. Studies such as this one have the potential to identify preventable causes of disease and guide public policies.},

A retrospective study is conducted to collect recorded data about under-5 deaths and live births from 1996 to 2001 from Health Information Center and CAPMAS in Alexandria. Data used include sociodemographic and environmental conditions in Alexandria sub-districts digitized maps of Alexandria districts and sub-districts (scale 1 50 0000). The spatial analysis of the geographical database revealed that there is regional variations of U5MR. GIS overlay analysis indicates that there is no association between low sociodemographic and environmental indicators and deaths caused by perinatal conditions and congenital malformations. The cause of death most associated with low sociodemographic and environmental indicators are found to be ARI and external causes of mortality. This is quietly evident in Amria and Borg Al Arab sub-districts.},

@article{Garcia-Ayllon2013,
abstract = {Spain's economic development is strongly influenced by an important urban growth on the coast for the past 50 years. This fact is associated with economic cycles and especially with the emergence of mass tourism. This phenomenon, marked by a strong seasonality, generates considerable controversy in urban and infrastructures planning. Resource consumption, land transformation and service management are variables to study to assess the development of the Spanish coast. It is necessary to introduce new systems of control and observation in the evolution of urban space towards ensuring the sustainability and competitiveness of our cities. The application of spatial information technologies to traditional governance methods is in this sense a future strategic commitment. This methodology is currently being investigated in the European Union. This paper takes a retrospective analysis of the evolution of the coastal development in the Mediterranean through the use of GIS tools and spatial information systems implemented in recent European research projects as OSDDT, Otremed and Pays-Med-Urban. {\textcopyright} 2013 WIT Press.},

@article{Cirucci2015,
abstract = {Geographic information science (GIS) and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) disciplines combine to provide valuable insights which guide decision-makers evaluating complex spatial criteria and alternatives, especially when there are conflicting stakeholder values and objectives. Although GIS and MCDA methods have been integrated to support forward-looking decision analyses, there is also advantage to applying these methods retrospectively in order to decipher the factors that composed previous spatially-complex decisions. The objective of this study is to demonstrate a methodology which applies " retrospective GIS-based MCDA " to characterize decision-maker value preferences in past siting decisions without a priori knowledge of the decision-making process. As a representative case study, retrospective GIS-based MCDA is performed on municipal solid waste transfer station site decisions in Los Angeles County, California. Potential attribute data were identified and compiled into a geographic information system. The attributes of actual facility sites and their surrounding vicinities were established as the presence case for a positive decision. This decision problem was structured considering two MCDA decision model types - value function using weighted linear combination and reference point. The attributes of historical site selections were decomposed and compared to unselected sites to identify attribute patterns. The value function MCDA model was parameterized using logistic regression to establish relative attribute weights which were applied to create a probability spatial distribution profile. The reference point MCDA rule model was parameterized contrasting attribute relative frequency Pareto between transfer station and general locations to create a satisfaction spatial distribution profile. These resulting models provide both relative rank and objective level of attributes represented in previous waste transfer station location decisions. The methodology is applicable to evaluation of spatial decisions in other domains, and can be extended to consider other MCDA decision models.},

@article{Sonnberger2017,
abstract = {In this study, we tested how attitudes toward the German energy transition, the perceived fairness of decision-making processes and their outcomes, the perceived risks and benefits of wind energy, and the trust in key actors (federal government, local government, large energy companies, and municipal utilities) affect both the general acceptance and local acceptance (acceptance of wind farms situated 500 m from the respondents' home) of wind farms in Germany. The respective data were gained from a representative random survey (n = 2.009) in Germany. The findings show that most of the aforementioned predictors significantly influence the public acceptance of wind energy. Perceived risks and fairness become (more) important in the context of both general and local acceptance of onshore wind farms, while the general attitude toward the energy transition is of greater relevance in the context of the general acceptance of offshore wind farms. Furthermore, trust in large energy companies plays a mixed role concerning general and local acceptance. Our results provide valuable insights for understanding public reactions toward wind energy projects.},

@article{Scherhaufer2017,
abstract = {Wind energy is a key technology in the transition toward a low-carbon society, but acceptance is considered to be a constraining factor in achieving ambitious wind deployment targets. Based on an Austrian case study, this paper investigates eight decisive patterns of acceptance and non-acceptance of wind energy. We apply qualitative research methods, such as interviews, focus groups, and WorldCaf\'{e} discussions, with stakeholders on the national level and with citizens and local decision-makers at potential wind power expansion sites. The results show that local opposition to wind energy cannot be explained by single factors but is caused by a complex set of individual and collective preferences rooted in institutional and socio-political arrangements. The problem concerning these conflicting patterns is that they are trapped in often opposing or confronting policy core beliefs, which are unlikely to change. Hence, it is necessary to appeal to overarching targets like the claims of environmental justice to counterbalance the impacts of wind energy. We conclude that there is a strong demand for fair decision-making processes and an equal distribution of environmental and economic gains and losses.},
